[2026-01-27 18:15] Auto-Blogger System Recovery
- Error Diagnosis: Git conflict during automated push and schedule skipping (10min interval too aggressive).
- Fix Applied:
  - Workflow schedule changed to hourly ('0 * * * *').
  - Added 'git pull --rebase' before push in workflow to prevent conflicts.
- Verification:
  - Manually ran 'auto_blogger.py' locally.
  - Generated 'posts/Posting/Trend/trend-2026-01-27-1811.md'.
  - Updated 'assets/history.json' with fix details.
  - Forced push to main branch (resolved conflicts).

[2026-01-27 18:15] Auto-Blogger System Recovery
- Error Diagnosis: Git conflict during automated push and schedule skipping (10min interval too aggressive).
- Fix Applied:
  - Workflow schedule changed to hourly ('0 * * * *').
  - Added 'git pull --rebase' before push in workflow to prevent conflicts.
- Verification:
  - Manually ran 'auto_blogger.py' locally.
  - Generated 'posts/Posting/Trend/trend-2026-01-27-1811.md'.
  - Updated 'assets/history.json' with fix details.
  - Forced push to main branch (resolved conflicts).

[2026-01-27 18:30] Auto-Blogger Dependency Fix
- Problem Identified: Summarization failing due to missing dependencies
  - Missing 'punkt_tab' NLTK tokenizer
  - Missing 'numpy' package (required by sumy LSA algorithm)
- Fix Applied:
  - Updated 'scripts/auto_blogger.py' to download 'punkt_tab'
  - Updated '.github/workflows/daily-trend.yml' to install 'punkt_tab'
  - Added 'numpy' to 'scripts/requirements.txt'
  - Installed numpy locally via 'python3 -m pip install numpy'
- Verification:
  - Generated 'posts/Posting/Trend/trend-2026-01-27-1827.md' with working summaries
  - Cleaned up 4 broken test files (1718, 1811, 1815, 1818)
  - Updated 'assets/history.json' with fix details
  - Pushed to main branch successfully
- Result: Auto-Blogger now generates proper English summaries from Hacker News articles

[2026-01-27 18:50] Auto-Blogger Enhancement: Korean Translation & Quality Filtering
- Added Korean Translation:
  - Installed 'googletrans==4.0.0-rc1' library
  - Translate both titles and summaries to Korean
  - Example: "Porting 100k lines from TypeScript to Rust" → "한 달 안에 Claude Code를 사용하여 TypeScript에서 Rust로 100,000줄 포팅"
- Strengthened Tech Filtering:
  - Core programming keywords required (code, programming, git, api, framework, etc.)
  - Exclude non-tech topics (airport, travel, etc.)
  - Minimum score threshold: 100 upvotes
- Added Validation Logic:
  - Skip posts with failed summarization (< 50 chars)
  - Detect and skip JavaScript errors/paywalls
  - Abort if no valid posts generated
- Result: Auto-generates high-quality Korean programming content hourly
